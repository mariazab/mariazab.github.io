            <p>
                My name is Marysia (officially Maria, but I prefer to be called like this. It’s a Polish thing). 
                Currently, finishing my Business Information Technology degree at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki, Finland. 
                <br /><br />
                In 2016, I got bachelor’s degree in International Business at University of Economics in Katowice, Poland. 
                Back then, I was feeling that my studies aren’t completely my thing and are not that interesting to me. 
                I wasn’t sure where to go from there, or even if I wanted to continue in this direction. 
                After some fortunate coincidences, I found myself living in Finland, where I stumbled upon the BITE studies at Haaga-Helia. 
                I immediately became interested, seeing an opportunity to change my career path, 
                as well as maybe discover something exciting to do in my life (especially that I always wanted to learn coding anyway). 
                So, I applied. At first, as an open student, as the deadline had passed already, but also to see how I like it. 
                The first semester was great. It turned out that not only I enjoy programming a lot but I’m also good at it. 
                Three years later, I completed the Software Engineering specialisation with flying colours and I’m about to complete my degree. 
                During this time, I gained a lot of knowledge on many various courses and I had fun making individual and team projects &#128516;

                    In my free time I like to do usual stuff: 
                    hang out with my friends, go to the cinema, read, listen to music, sometimes do some sports and travel, when I have the chance. 
                    But I also like knitting and crocheting, skiing (although lately I haven’t been able to ski as much as I used to), 
                    taking photos and I am a huge fan of ski jumping &#128515;
